# Christina George Artist Portfolio Website
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ad88f65e-0ea5-4e88-92e9-88f128fe9055/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/christinageorgeart/deploys)

[Christinageorgeart.com](https://christinageorgeart.com) is a single-page artist portfolio site built using Jekyll and Foundation 6 and hosted on Netlify.

The sections on the landing page are built in a modular format using Jekyll Collections for added flexibility. Each section is an individual collection item, and the homepage (index.html) iterates over them in the specified order. This creates maximum flexibility &mdash; if the client later wanted to, for example, make each section a separate page, I could easily make the change without modifying any of the section's markup. This provides a useful model for other similar landing page designs.

Body text is set in Sofia Pro Soft by Olivier Gourvat, and headings are set in Orpheus by Kevin King, Patrick Griffin, and Walter Tiemann. All fonts are served from Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit).
