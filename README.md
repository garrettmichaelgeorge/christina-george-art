# Christina George Artist Portfolio Website

This is a single-page portfolio site built for a painter built using Jekyll and Foundation 6 and hosted on Netlify.

The sections on the landing page are built in a modular format using Jekyll Collections for added flexibility. Each section is an individual collection item, and the homepage (index.html) iterates over them in the specified order.

Body text is set in Sofia Pro Soft by Olivier Gourvat, and headings are set in Orpheus by Kevin King, Patrick Griffin, and Walter Tiemann. All fonts are served from Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit).

The site's code repository is open source. All site content, including images, Â©2020 Christina George. All rights reserved.
